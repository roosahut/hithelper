My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on
This nine-to-five ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round,"" we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord

[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They know me and Jack Daniеl's got a history
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Evеrybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

[Verse 2]
I've been Boozey since I left
I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma I ain't forget (Oh Lord), I
Woke up drunk at 10 a.m.​
We gon' do this shit again
Tell your girl to bring a friend, oh Lord

Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

The kids are in town for a funeral
So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty of young blood left in 'em
And plenty nights under pink skies you taught 'em to enjoy

[Verse 2]
So clean the house, clear the drawers, mop the floors, stand tall
Like no one's ever been here before or at all
And don't you mention all the inches that are scraped on the doorframe
We all know you tiptoed up to 4'1"" back in '08

[Chorus]
If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppiеs
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God hеard you comin'

[Verse 3]
The kids are in town for a funeral
And the grass all smells the same as the day you broke your arm swingin'
On that kid out on the river
You bailed him out, never said a thing about Jesus or the way he's livin'

If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppies

I was all but twenty-two, I think at the time
I'd been out on the road lonely at night
And it'd been a while, huh, so it was on my mind
Well, I saw him walk in with his cowboy hat
And I thought to myself, ""I could use some of that""
His boots like glass on a sawdust floor, huh
Had moves like nothin' I'd ever seen before
So I walked right up, and I pulled him to the side
I handed that man a beer and looked him in the eyes
And I said, ""Baby, I think you're gonna wanna hear this""
Then I told him

[Chorus: Ella Langley]
""Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me to want you to come on home
And, baby, I don't blame you

When this cute little country girl caught my eye
And, boy, let me tell you
She was the prettiest thing I'd ever seen in a pair of boots
Well, she walked right up to me, handed me a beer
Gave me a look like, ""Let's get outta here""

El muchacho se fue pa' arriba
Le sobra la calidad
De varias la ha librado andando en la patrulla
Las ganas de superarme por las noches me perturban
Sigo siendo el mismo, solo que cambie los planes y los medios zumban
Y de repente nos vamos de rumba
Porque hoy se puede hacer lo que me gusta
Los doble cara me caen en la punta
Y lo peor del caso que de esos abundan

[Coro: Peso Pluma]
Me muero si tú no estás
Véngase pa' acá, mi nena, mamá
Véngase, márqueme a mi celular

Got promoted back in April and you met someone
Your dad says he's okay
Well, I've never been better
Things are going my way

Oh, and I ain't been lonely since you said goodbye
I wish I could say I miss you
But you know I never lie

Yeah, I met somebody too
She's a model out in LA
And she's begging me to move
She's says Malibu is really great
Ain't decided if I'm going or not

To take my love away
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name
Not today, not tomorrow
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow
I got change (Yup), you could borrow (Borrow)
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow

[Chorus]
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?

[Refrain]
Did you take
My love away
From me? Me
Me

[Verse 2]
Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face
Said, ""I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break""
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?

He had hard work caked on his overalls
Sweat on his neck, chaw in his jaw
When a stranger pulled up and met him outside his barn
Said, ""Sir, I don't know if you ever would
But I build houses and neighborhoods
And I was wondering if you'd ever wanna sell your farm""
With his old dog barking and running around
He paused for a second, spit on the ground
Then kicked a little gravel, looked down and said

Ain't no more holdin' her hand, it's time to expand
She wanna get on the 'Gram and take pics in the sand
She tryna work on her tan, you ever been to Thailand?
We ain't gotta pack no clothes, we can shop when we land
You want bad-bitch views? What you willin' to do?
She can't come to your room unless it's in Tulum
You ain't rеady for her, I think you should slow your roll
Is you ready for her? No, no, no, no, no
Shе's a passport junkie, spend that bread like a dummy
Yeah, he met her on Sunday, was in the airport by Monday
If you really gettin' money, take that girl out the country
She like niggas that's fun, they takin' shots, gettin' blunted
I'll do whatever for your love, it ain't no leavin' me
Spend a million in a month, who gon' compete with me?
I might take her to Paris, fly out her whole family
He rented a yacht and took her to Miami
Listen, listen, listen, I love Miami
But she don't wanna go no more
She don't wanna go no more
'Cause it's not the same
Times change
Oh, how the times change
She don't wanna go no more
She a passport junkie
Takin' trips out the country
Takin' trips out the country
Oh, how the times change
'Cause it's not the same
Oh, how the times change (Ayy, listen)
She don't wanna go no more (If you ain't got no bag, you can't even bag her, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
She don't wanna go no more (Oh, youngin)
